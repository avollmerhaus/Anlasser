# A word of warning to whomever might try to redesign this code.
# Do not try and wait for the bhyve subprocess from inside a signal handler.
# An early implementation of Anlasser tried to do this to no avail.
# Invoking a signal handler "freezes" the normal execution of the program,
# resuming only after the handler is done.
# In a way, executing a signal handler while the main program freezes is like threading.
# So the main "thread" is already waiting in bhyve subprocess `communicate()`, but it's suspended.
# Having one suspended `communicate()` going and then starting another one from inside the signal handler is a
# recipe for trouble. I ran into weird deadlocks.
# See https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82388
